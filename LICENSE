The Wija Permissive Personal-Use License for Software (WPPLs v1)
(c wijathemidja 2026)

The Wija Permissive Personal-Use License for software (referred to shorthand as WPPLs or in this document 'the license') aims to be a simple license that covers software made by a person.

The software is defined by what this license is packaged with.

The license permits:
    1. Any personal use of the software in any form, as long as it abides by international and national law
    2. The private hosting and modification of said software
        a. This must not be hosted to the public, for instance on the internet, without the permission of the author of the software (wijathemidja)
            For instance, hosting the software on a local area network (if applicable to the software) would be permitted, as it is not hugely accessible to the public.
        b. The software may be modified in any way as long as it is not harmful, malicious or illegal in any way.
        c. Any modified software may not be redistributed in any way, unless completely non-public.

The license disallows:
    3. The software to be used commercially
    4. The redistribution of the software
    5. The removal of this license in the event the code is modified
    6. The use of the software in any illegal form
